# **Behind the Code**

This code is a TicTacToe game made in C++.
The code has a logic where the game board is represented as an array of characters. The array is initialized with numbers, and the player selects a position to mark X or O. 
The code constantly verifies if three positions are marked with the same symbol. If this verification returns false, the game continues until the number of plays equals nine. However, if the verification returns true, the game ends and shows the results.

## **Main Knowledge Learned**

### **If-else (ternary operator)**
The main knowledge learned in this project was the use of the ternary operator, shown in the line: `tabela[posicao - 1] = (jogador_vez == 1) ? 'X' : 'O';`. This is a compacted if-else variation, where if the condition is satisfied, the first part is executed; otherwise, the second part of the code will be executed.

### **Arrays**

The code also helped me reinforce my understanding of operations using arrays and their logic.
